This library allows to draw different shapes, lines, marks easily. It's customizable and provides posibility to fill your custom shapes by color or gradient. Also you can fill just by stroke with color or gradient. If you want to add some labels or marks on your shapes or lines it's not difficult with this toolbox.

```gradle
allprojects {
	repositories {
		// ... other repositories
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```
Then add the dependencies that you need in your project.

```
dependencies {
	compile 'com.github.gleb8k:Android-PathShapeView:1.1.4'
